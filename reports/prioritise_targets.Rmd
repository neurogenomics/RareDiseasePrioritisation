# Prioritise targets

## Filter & sort

```{r} 
res <- MultiEWCE::prioritise_targets()
```


### Top targets 

Here are the top gene targets based on the default filtering/sorting criterion of `prioritise_targets`.

```{r}
MultiEWCE::create_dt(res$top_targets)
```

### Filtering report 

Here is a report that shows how many phenotypes/celltypes/genes remained
after each step within the `prioritise_targets` pipeline.

```{r}
MultiEWCE::create_dt(res$report)
```


## Plot network

Generate a network from the top phenotype-celltype-gene associations.

```{r, fig.height=20, results='asis'}
vn_top <- MultiEWCE::prioritise_targets_network(top_targets = res$top_targets, 
                                                 save_path = here::here("reports",
                                                            "top_targets_network.html"),
                                                show_plot = FALSE)
# visNetwork::renderVisNetwork(vn_top$plot)
```

```{r, results='asis'}
htmltools::includeHTML("https://github.com/neurogenomics/RareDiseasePrioritisation/raw/master/reports/top_targets_network.html")
```

## Aggregate results

```{r}
df_agg <- MultiEWCE::agg_results(
    phenos = res$top_targets,
    count_var = "CellType", 
    group_var = c("Phenotype","ontLvl",
                  "tier","tier_auto",
                  "ancestor","ancestor_name",
                  "disease_characteristic","DiseaseNames",
                  "Onset","Onset_earliest","Onset_score_mean","Onset_score_min",
                  "pheno_freq_mean","pheno_freq_min",
                  "Severity_score_mean","Severity_score_min")
    )

MultiEWCE::create_dt(df_agg)
```

### Aggregate results

Subset phenotypes to those included in intellectual disability, 
and are related to cognition.

```{r}

df_intel <- HPOExplorer::add_ancestor(
    phenos = res$top_targets[ancestor_name=="Abnormality of the nervous system",][,-c("ancestor","ancestor_name")],
                                      lvl = 5)
df_intel <- df_intel[
    ancestor_name %in% c("Neurodevelopmental abnormality"),]
sort(unique(df_intel$Phenotype))
```

### Top genes

```{r} 
top_genes <- sort(table(df_intel$Gene),
                  decreasing = TRUE)
print(top_genes)
```

### Top cell types

```{r} 
top_celltypes <- sort(table(unique(df_intel[,c("Phenotype","HPO_ID","CellType")])$CellType),
         decreasing = TRUE)
print(top_celltypes)
```

# Prioritise targets: extended

Now let's lift some of the filters on phenotypes and cell types
to recover a more extensive network.

## Filter & sort

```{r}
res_all <- MultiEWCE::prioritise_targets(keep_onsets = NULL,
                                         keep_tiers = NULL,
                                         severity_threshold = NULL,
                                         pheno_frequency_threshold = c(10,NA),
                                         gene_frequency_threshold = c(10,NA),
                                         keep_specificity_quantiles = seq(20,40),
                                         keep_mean_exp_quantiles = seq(20,40))
```

## Plot network

Note that we set `physics=FALSE` to reduce the computation that it takes to render the plot.

```{r, fig.height=20} 
vn_all <- MultiEWCE::prioritise_targets_network(top_targets = res_all$top_targets, 
                                                save_path = here::here("reports",
                                                            "all_targets_network.html"), 
                                                physics = FALSE,  
                                                show_plot = FALSE)
```

```{r, results='asis'}
htmltools::includeHTML("https://github.com/neurogenomics/RareDiseasePrioritisation/raw/master/reports/all_targets_network.html")
```

### [Full screen version](https://neurogenomics.github.io/RareDiseasePrioritisation/reports/all_targets_network.html)

## Aggregate results

```{r}
all_agg <- MultiEWCE::agg_results(phenos = res_all$top_targets,
                                  count_var = "CellType", 
                                  group_var = "Phenotype")

MultiEWCE::create_dt(all_agg) 
```

### Top phenotypes

          decreasing = TRUE))

#### Only lower ontology levels #####
all_targets <- HPOExplorer::add_ont_lvl(res_all$top_targets)
head(sort(table(unique(res_all$top_targets[ontLvl<=4,c("Phenotype","CellType")])$Phenotype), 
          decreasing = TRUE))
```

          decreasing = TRUE))
```

### Top genes

    `colnames<-`(c("HPO_ID","freq"))
ancestor_freq$Phenotype <- HPOExplorer::harmonise_phenotypes(phenotypes = ancestor_freq$HPO_ID)

MultiEWCE::create_dt(ancestor_freq) 
```

# Manual queries

Get all results. 

```{r}
res_all <- MultiEWCE::prioritise_targets(keep_onsets = NULL,
                                         keep_tiers = NULL,
                                         severity_threshold = NULL,
                                         pheno_frequency_threshold = NULL,
                                         gene_frequency_threshold = NULL,
                                         keep_specificity_quantiles = NULL,
                                         keep_mean_exp_quantiles = NULL)
```


## Mental deterioration

> Loss of previously present mental abilities, generally in adults.
> Synonyms:    Cognitive decline, Cognitive decline, progressive, Intellectual deterioration, Mental deterioration, Progressive cognitive decline

Not included in `prioritse_targets` outputs by default because:
    - "tier_auto=3"
    - "specificity_quantile" (median=6) and "mean_exp_quantile" (median=6) are quite low for most genes associated with "Mental deterioration"

```{r}  
md_targets <- res_all$top_targets[Phenotype=="Mental deterioration" & q<=0.05] 

sort(table(md_targets[CellType %in% c("Amacrine cells","Ganglion cells")]$Gene), 
     decreasing = TRUE)
```
