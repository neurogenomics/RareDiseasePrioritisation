```{r}
res <- KGExplorer::map_upheno()
```

## Phenotype overlap

Summary plot showing the proportion of orthologous genes overlapping between HPO and non-human ontology databases (within a given phenotype), repeated across many phenotypes.

```{r}
res$plots$rainplot
```

## Equivalence score vs. Proportion overlap

For all cross-species phenotype mappings, test if there is a relationship between the semantic equivalence score provided by uPheno and the proportion of orthologous genes overlapping with HPO.

```{r}
res$plots$scatterplot
```

## Top therapy candidates

```{r, fig.height=20}
res$plots$heatmap
